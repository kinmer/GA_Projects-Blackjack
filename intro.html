            <h4>Game Rules</h4><br>
            <article>
                <p>Basic rules are the same as in the game of Blackjack. However, there is no insurance, and players can only split their hand once.
                Don Johnson, as the defending champion, will play the role of the dealer.</p>

                <p>Each player starts with 1000 coins; the initial bet amount is 10. The game advances to the next level every three minutes, doubling the bet amount with each level up. 
                The game continues until one player wins all of their opponent's money.</p>
                <p> **Please Note** that there's only one chance, and if failed, only one more name will be added to the countless list of runners-up.</p>
